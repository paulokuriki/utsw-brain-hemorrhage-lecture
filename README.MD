## Jupyter Notebook Overview
The accompanying Jupyter notebook takes users on an explorative journey of machine learning features:
1. Basic Classification: Distinguishing between apples and oranges using the 'sweetness' feature.
2. Advanced Classification: Differentiating between apples and bananas using multiple features.
3. Image Features: Understanding and transforming image data suitable for machine learning.

The [notebook](https://github.com/paulokuriki/utsw-brain-hemorrhage-lecture/blob/main/input_and_models.ipynb) combines theoretical explanations with practical Python code, making it ideal for learners at all levels.
